I would like you to convert this file in csv respecting this requirements of this table : 
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `expenses_by_items` (
    `id` INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    `user_id` INT NOT NULL,
    `category_id` INT,
    `qty` INT UNSGINED NOT NULL CHECK (`qty` > 0),
    `qty_unit` ENUM('unit', 'gram') NOT NULL,
    `price_per_item` DECIMAL(8,2) UNSIGNED NOT NULL CHECK (`price_per_item` >= 0),
    `price_unit` ENUM('unit', 'gram') NOT NULL,
    `purchase_date` DATE NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (`user_id`) REFERENCES `users`(`id`) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (`category_id`) REFERENCES `categories`(`id`) ON DELETE SET NULL
);

Moreover, here is the category, you would need to complete the table.
